<h2>Memoir</h2>
<p>üéØ Sundar Pichai (born June 10, 1972) is a prominent computer engineer and the current CEO of Google LLC, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Pichai, who had been serving as Google's head of Products and Engineering, was named the new CEO of Google in August 2015, following the restructuring of Google into Alphabet Inc., a parent company housing several businesses including Google, Verily, and Waymo. As CEO, Pichai oversees Google's core businesses, including Search, Ads, Maps, YouTube, Android, and its cloud computing division.</p>

<p>üöÄ  Pichai joined Google in 2004 as a product manager and quickly became known for his leadership and vision. He led the innovative efforts for several of Google's major products, including Google Chrome and Chrome OS, both of which have become highly successful. Under his guidance, Chrome became the most popular web browser in the world, and Chrome OS gained significant traction in the education market. Pichai also played a crucial role in the development and success of other Google products like Gmail and Google Docs.</p>

<p>üåü  Born in Chennai, India, Pichai exhibited a keen interest in technology and innovation from a young age. He earned his Bachelor of Technology degree in Metallurgical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, where he was recognized as an outstanding student. He later pursued an M.S. in Material Sciences and Engineering from Stanford University and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was named a Siebel Scholar and a Palmer Scholar.</p>

<p>üíº  Before joining Google, Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey & Company. His diverse experience and deep understanding of technology and business strategy made him a valuable asset to Google.</p>

<p>üîë  Pichai is well-regarded by his colleagues and is often described as the driving force behind many of Google's most important products. Known for his thoughtful and inclusive leadership style, he has been instrumental in fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration at Google. In 2014, Pichai was suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO position, a role that ultimately went to Satya Nadella. Reflecting on Pichai's achievements, his thrilled professor Sanat Roy told the Times of India, "I had seen this coming."</p>

<p>üåê  Under Pichai's leadership, Google has continued to thrive, expanding its influence and maintaining its position as a leader in the technology industry. Pichai's vision for the future includes a strong emphasis on artificial intelligence and machine learning, which he believes will be pivotal in shaping the next era of computing.</p>

<p>üéì  Beyond his professional achievements, Pichai is also known for his philanthropic efforts. He has been involved in various initiatives aimed at promoting education and technology access, particularly in underserved communities. His journey from a middle-class family in Chennai to the helm of one of the world's most influential companies serves as an inspiring testament to the power of education, hard work, and visionary leadership.</p>
